Basic Java project that integrates Spring,Maven,JDBC

Many-a-times we need to have do a web project. Suppose we are at a Hackathon and we need to showcase our project. So, we should concentrate on the main logic behind the project and not behind setting up the project and all.
This Java project integrates:
1. Spring MVC
2. Maven
3. JDBC  

This project can be used as a starting point for any web project and used for adding logic based on it. Sometimes we have issues in configuring the paths/resources folder. Trying to fix those can be a tiring task. So, there it is. Download it and use it.
